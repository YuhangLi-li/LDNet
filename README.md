We manually collected a new pairwise dataset consisting of 6045 pairs of low-exposure images with different degrees, and each short-exposure image has a corresponding normal-exposure image. Our dataset provides a larger amount of data and scene richness. More importantly, there are different underexposure levels in the dataset, ranging from slightly underexposed images to dark images.  

Large-scale datasets with multiple scenes and rich lighting conditions are extremely meaningful for training networks with generalization ability. It is well known that the time consumption and complexity of manual collection of real datasets are enormous. We expand some scenes that are not available in existing datasets, such as portraits, objects with motion, and extremely dark environments.
